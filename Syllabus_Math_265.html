<h2>Discrete Mathematics – Math 265</h2>
<!--
### Acknowledgement: 
We acknowledge the land that Fort Lewis College is situated upon is the ancestral land and
territory of the Nuuchiu (Ute) people who were forcibly removed by the United States Government. We also acknowledge that this land is connected to the communal and ceremonial spaces of the Jicarilla Abache (Apache), Pueblos
of New Mexico, Hopi Sinom (Hopi), and Din ́e (Navajo) Nations. It is important to acknowledge this setting because
the narratives of the lands in this region have long been told from dominant perspectives, without full recognition
of the original land stewards who continue to inhabit and connect with this land. Thank you for your attention and
respect in acknowledging this important legacy.

<h3>Course Requirements &amp; Grading Policies</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exams</strong>: There are 4 midterm exams:

<ul>
<li>Friday, 19 – September</li>
<li>Friday, 17 – October</li>
<li>Monday, 9 – November</li>
<li>Friday, 5 – December</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong>: There will be a quiz in non-exam weeks. These are in class activities; no early or late quizzes. I understand sometimes things happen: I’ll drop 2 low quiz scores.</p></li>
<li><strong>Quiz and exam policies</strong>:

<ul>
<li>no electric devices are allowed for quizzes and exams</li>
<li>quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes, no formula sheet</li>
<li>I will ask you to not leave the room during quizzes and exams. (Get a drink, use the restroom, etc. before.) If you have a learning accommodation that allows you to leave the room, I ask that you schedule quizzes and exams with the Testing Center.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Homework</strong>: I will assign weekly homework.

<ul>
<li>I encourage you to start early. Read the questions as soon as they are assigned and watch out for the relevant topics in class. As soon as we’ve talked about the needed topic, start that problem.</li>
<li>No late homework will be accepted.</li>
<li>I encourage you to work together on the homework. But after you have found a solution, sit down by yourself and write the solution.</li>
<li>The homework is meant to help <em>you</em> learn mathematics. Please refrain from using the internet and AI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some presentation guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Please start each problem on a new sheet of paper.</li>
<li>Your presentation should be professional:

<ul>
<li>Turn in your “final” work, not the scratch work.</li>
<li>Staple multiple pages, and remove spirals.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll collect these the old fashioned way – on paper.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your <strong>final letter grade</strong> will be calculated as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Homework: 20%</li>
<li>Quizzes: 20%</li>
<li>Midterm exams: 48% (12% each)</li>
<li>Final exam: 12%</li>
</ul>

<p>If <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is your overall point percentage, your letter grade will be assigned according to:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(93 \leq G \leq 100\)</span>: A</li>
<li><span class="math">\(90 \leq G &lt; 93\)</span>: A-</li>
<li><span class="math">\(87 \leq G &lt; 90\)</span>: B+</li>
<li><span class="math">\(83 \leq G &lt; 87\)</span>: B</li>
<li><span class="math">\(80 \leq G &lt; 83\)</span>: B-</li>
<li><span class="math">\(77 \leq G &lt; 80\)</span>: C+</li>
<li><span class="math">\(73 \leq G &lt; 77\)</span>: C</li>
<li><span class="math">\(70 \leq G &lt; 73\)</span>: C-</li>
<li><span class="math">\(67 \leq G &lt; 70\)</span>: D+</li>
<li><span class="math">\(63 \leq G &lt; 67\)</span>: D</li>
<li><span class="math">\(60 \leq G &lt; 63\)</span>: D-</li>
<li><span class="math">\(G &lt; 60\)</span>: F</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Expectations</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is an in-person class. You are expected to be in class each day.</li>
<li>Please arrive on time and refrain from coming and going during the class period. It is disruptive and discourteous to both your peers and to me if you arrive late, leave early, or frequently come and go.</li>
<li>Be prepared to actively engage in class every day:

<ul>
<li>keeping up with the homework will help you be prepared to actively engage with the material each day</li>
<li>putting your phone away will help you focus</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ultimately the goal of this class is that <em>you</em> understand the topics and that <em>you</em> are able to answer questions, both conceptual and computational. Keep this in mind when and how you do homework problems. I’m certain that every problem in this class has a solution that can be found online either in the old fashioned online way, or by AI. Be mindful and intentional about how you use technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Academic dishonesty includes all forms of unethical or illegal behavior which affects a student’s academic standing,
including, but not limited to, cheating on exams, plagiarism, forgery of academic documents, falsification of information on academic documents, or unauthorized access to computer files containing academic information. Academic
dishonesty may result in sanctions ranging from a lowered grade on a particular assignment to an “F” in the class
and report submitted to the Office of the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

<h3>Faculty Statement on Suitable AI Use in the Course</h3>

<p>No electric devices may be used during quizzes or exams. How you use AI outside of class is up to you. I encourage you to ask yourself whether your use of AI (or the internet in general) is helping you to learn, or helping you get the “final answer.” </p>

<h3>Accessibility Resource Center</h3>

<p>Fort Lewis College is committed to providing all students with a liberal arts education through a personalized learning environment. If you think you have or you do have a documented disability that will need reasonable academic
accommodations, please visit our website for more information: <a class="autolink" href="https://fortlewis.edu/accessibilityresourcecenter">fortlewis.edu/accessibilityresourcecenter</a></p>
<!-- 
### Equity, Diversity, Inclusion: 

We value the contributions of all members of our mathematics community to improve mathematics research, education, and the standing of the mathematical sciences. We recognize the breadth of
people, thought, and experience that contribute to mathematics research, education, and all related professions. We
welcome everyone interested in mathematics as we work to build a community that is diverse, respectful, accessible,
and inclusive. We are committed to ensuring equitable access to mathematics opportunities and resources for people
of any race, ethnicity, religious belief, gender identity, age, economic background, disability status, or any other social
or physical component of their identity. (Adapted from AMS statement on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.)
